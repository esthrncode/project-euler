# Project Euler Solutions

This space is dedicated to documenting my self-learning journey through the fascinating and challenging problems posed by of solutions for [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) problems. This repository contains my approaches to solving  computational problems posed by Project Euler.

## Learning goals
- **Deep Dive into Mathematics**
- **Sharpen Algorithmic Thinking**
- **Programming Practice**

## My Apprach to Learning and Problem Solving
- **Research**: I begin by delving into the theoretical background necessary for each problem, whether it's a new concept or a refresher.
- **Iteration**:  My solutions often start simple and evolve through testing and optimization, reflecting the iterative nature of problem-solving.
- **Reflection**: After solving a problem, I take the time to note and reflect on the solution, the strategies used, and the lessons learned.
