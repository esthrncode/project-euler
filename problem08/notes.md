# Project Euler Problem 8 

Project Euler Problem 8 asks us to find the greatest product of `k` consecutive digits in a large number. This problem we have a common issue is handling the number correctly as a string and performing the calculations.

**Issue Encountered**

When I attempted to calculate the product of consecutive digits, a `TypeError` was encountered:

```plaintext
TypeError: can't multiply sequence by non-int of type 'str'
```
